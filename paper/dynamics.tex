\begin{abstract}

Micro-task crowdsourcing is gaining popularity among serval organizations and research corps to leverage Human Computation in their daily operations. Unlike any other ``technology'', a crowdsourcing platform is subject to many factors that affect the performance, both in terms of speed and quality, of its services. Indeed, such factors shape the \emph{dynamics} of the market. For example, a common result is that increasing the price of a HIT would lead to faster results, however, we still do not know the exact impact of changing the price in the presence of many reputable requesters on the platform. Or, what happen when you post a link of a batch on a popular crowdsourcing forum etc.

In this paper we adopt a data-driven approach to analyze the behavior of the main actors in MTurk micro-task crowdsourcing: workers, requesters, HITs, and platform (MTurk); thanks to a collection of datasets that we gathered during the last 5 year.

The ultimate contribution that we propose is a predictive model to derive the expected performance of a published batch of HITs on MTurk at a specific moment in time.
