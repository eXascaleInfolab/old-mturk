\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we presented an analysis of the evolution of micro-task crowdsourcing over the past five years.
We studied data collected from a popular micro-task crowdsourcing platform, \amt{},
and analyzed a number of key dimensions of the platform, including: topic, task type, reward evolution, platform throughput, and supply and demand curves. The results of our analysis can serve as a starting point for improving existing crowdsourcing platforms and to optimize the overall efficiency and effectiveness of human computation systems. The evidence presented above indicate how requesters should use crowdsourcing platforms to obtain the best out of them: By engaging with workers and publishing large volumes of HITs at specific points in time. 

%For this purpose we created a system that can support requesters in publishing their HITs optimizing for throughput\footnote{\url{http://xi-lab.github.io/mturk-mrkt/}}.

Future research based on this work might look at different directions. On one hand, novel micro-task crowdsourcing platforms need to be designed based on the findings identified in this work, such as the need for supporting specific task types like audio transcription or surveys.

Additionally, analyses that look at specific data could provide a deeper understanding of the micro-task crowdsourcing universe. Examples include per-requester or per-task analyses of the publishing behavior rather than looking at the entire market evolution as we did in this work. 
%This can lead to a definition of different classes of requesters which will provide a better understanding of requester requirements (e.g., support for specific task types like surveys or support in identifying the most appropriate workers in the crowd). 
Similarly, a worker-centered analysis could provide additional evidence of the existence of different classes of workers, e.g., full-time vs casual workers, or workers specializing on specific task types as compared to generalists who are willing to complete any task available.
