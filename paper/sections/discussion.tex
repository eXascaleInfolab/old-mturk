\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discuss}

In this section, we summarize the main findings of our study and present a discussion of our results. We  extracted several trends from the five years data, summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
	\item Tasks related to audio transcription have been gaining momentum in the last years and are today the most popular tasks on \amt{}.
	\item The popularity of Content Access HITs has decreased over time. Surveys are however becoming more popular over time especially in the US.
	\item While most HITs do not require country-specific workers, most of such HITs require US-based workers.
	\item HITs that are exclusively asking for workers based in India have strongly decreased over time.
	\item Surveys are the most popular type of HITs for US-based workers.
	\item The most frequent HIT reward value has increased over time, and reaches \$0.05 in 2014.
	\item New requesters constantly join \amt{}, making the total number of active requesters and the available reward increase over time.
	\item The average HIT batch size has been stable over time; however, very large batches have recently started to appear on the platform.
\end{itemize}

Our batch throughput prediction (Section~\ref{sec:throughput}) indicates that the throughput of HIT batches can be best predicted based on the number of HITs available in the batch (i.e., its size) and its freshness.

Finally, we analyzed \amt{} as a marketplace in terms of demand (new HITs arriving) and supply (HITs completed). 
%We saw, for instance, that higher demand does not lead to higher HIT prices. A possible explanation for this is the lack of bidding (or negotiation) mechanisms available to the workers; such mechanisms are not available on the current platforms though they could help workers drive the prices up. 
We observed some strong weekly periodicity both in demand and in supply. We can hypothesize that many requesters might have repetitive business needs following weekly trends, while many workers work on \amt{} on a regular basis during the week.
