\section{Features Used in the \\ Machine Learning}
The following is the list features that we used in our machine learning (see section \ref{sec:throughput}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item hits\_available:  Number of available HITs in the batch.
\item start\_time:  The time bucket of the Crawling.
\item reward: HIT Reward in USD.
\item description:  String length of the batch's description.
\item title: String size of the batch's title.
\item keywords : Keywords (space separated).
\item requester\_id:   ID of the requester.
\item time\_alloted : Time allotted per task.
\item tasktype : Task class (as per our classification in \ref{sec:type}).
\item ageminutes : Age since the Batch was posted (minutes).
\item leftminutes: Time left before expiration (minutes).
\item location: The requested worker's Location (e.g. US).
\item totalapproved: Batch requirement on \#total approved HITs.
\item approvalrate : Batch requirement on the \%of worker's approvals.
\item master : Worker is a master.
\item hitGroupsAvailableUI: Number of batches as reported on Mturk dashboard.
\item hitsAvailableUI : Number of HITs available as reported on Mturk dashboard.
\item hitsArrived : Number of new hits arrived.
\item hitsCompleted : Number of hits completed.
\item rewardsArrived : Sum of rewards associated with the HITs arrived.
\item rewardsCompleted : Sum of rewards associated with the HITs completed.
\item percHitsCompleted : Ratio of HITs completed and total hits available.
\item percHitsPosted : Ratio of new HITs arrived and total hits available.
\item diffHits : hitsCompleted-hitsArrived.
\item diffHitsUI : Difference in HITs observed from Mturk dashboard.
\item diffGroups  : Computed difference in number of completed and arrived batches.
\item diffGroupsUI : Difference in number of completed and arrived batches observed from Mturk dashboard.
\item diffRewards : Difference in rewards = (rewardsArrived-rewardsCompleted).
\item \textbf{DIFF\_HIT}  :  \textbf{Target Class}: Number of HITs completed for a given batch.
