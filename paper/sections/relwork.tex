In \cite{Kittur:2013:FCW:2441776.2441923} authors provide their view on how the crowdsourcing market should adapt specifically focusing on how to  support full-time crowd workers. On the other hand, in this work we perform a data-driven analysis of the evolution of micro-task crowdsourcing over the past five years using the findings of such analysis as features to support requesters while publishing HITs on these platforms in an effective way.
