\section{Market Analysis}
\label{sec:market}
Finally, we study the demand and supply of Amazon MTurk marketplace. In the following, we define $Demand$ as the number of new tasks published on the platform by the requesters. In addition, we compute the average reward of the tasks that were posted. Conversely, we define $Supply$ as the workforce that the crowd is providing concretized as the number of tasks that got completed in a given time window by the workers. Again, we compute the average reward of the completed tasks.
In this section we use hourly collected data for the time period between June-October 2014.

\subsection{Supply vs. Demand}
First, we check whether supply and demand, in the context of Amazon MTurk marketplace, exhibit the standard behavior and relationship.
Figure \ref{fig:dsup} (right) shows the expected relationship between supply and price: The larger the supply, the lower the price evolves, which is the usual behaviour. On the other hand, Figure \ref{fig:dsup} (left) demand does not match the typical ascending demand curve (``the higher the demand the higher the price evolves''). Instead, the demand seems to be tied to the supply (i.e., the number of new HITs completed).

	\caption{The supply and demand for HITs versus the average HIT price.}
	\label{fig:dsup}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Supply Attracts new Workers} %

Now, we examine how the supply attracts new workers. First, we compare the three following variables: number of HITs published on the platform, number of HITs completed, and the average reward per HIT of both published and completed tasks. The results are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:scatter_matrix}. The apparent correlation between the rewards of the HITs completed and those published, and also among their quantities, gives us a first intuition that the crowd workers are sensitive to newly posted tasks, especially for those with higher prices.

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/scatter}
	\caption{Scatter matrix comparing the different parameters in the demand and supply.}
	\label{fig:scatter_matrix}
\end{figure}

Next, We also analyze how the market reacts when new tasks arrive in the
market, to understand whether there is elasticity of supply. If the
supply of work is inelastic, the amount of work done over time should
be independent of the demand for work. So, if the amount of tasks
available in the market ("demand") increases, then the percentage of
work that gets completed in the market should drop, as the same of
amount of "work done" gets split among higher number of tasks. To
understand the elasticity of supply, we regressed the percentage of
work done in every time period (measured as the percentage of HITs
that are completed) against the number of new HITs that are posted in
that period. Figure \ref{fig:perc_hits_completed} shows the scatterplot for these two variables.
Our data reveal that an increase in the number of arrived HITs is
positively associated with a higher percentage of completed HITs. This
result provides evidence that the new work that is posted is more
attractive than the tasks available in the market, and attracts "new
work supply".\footnote{Whether the supply comes from more distinct
workers, from workers that were idle, or from increased productivity
of existing workers is not possible to tell from our data.}

\subsection{Demand and Supply Periodicity}
On the demand side, we often observe some requesters frequently posting new batches of recurrent tasks. Hence, we are interested in the periodicity of such demand in the marketplace and the supply it drives. For that, we consider both the time-series of available HITs and the rewards completed over the period of three months. 

First, we observe that the demand exhibits a strong weekly periodicity, which is reflected by the autocorrelation that we compute the number of available HITs on Amazon Mturk (See Figure \ref{fig:autocorrelation1}). The market seems to have a significant memory that lasts for approximately 7-10 days.

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/out}

        \label{fig:y equals x}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering

        \label{fig:three sin x}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill 
    \caption{Autocorrelation of the number of HITs available on MTurk time series. There is a significant correlation that lasts 7-10 days (see left part of the graph 0-250 Hours).}
	\label{fig:autocorrelation1}
\end{figure} 

Conversely, and to check for periodicity in the supply, we compute an autocorrelation on the weekly moving average convergence of the reward attached to completed HITs. Figure \ref{fig:autocorrelation2} shows that there is a strong weekly periodicity effect as we observe high values in the range 0-250 hours.
